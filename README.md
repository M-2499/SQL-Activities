# SQL- Projects

**Exploring My SQL Journey: From Concept to Code**

Welcome to my personal repository that unveils my journey through the fascinating world of SQL and beyond. Here, you'll find a curated collection of projects, solutions, and explorations that showcase my growth as a data enthusiast. 

**What to Expect:**
As you browse through the folders, you'll encounter a diverse range of topics, each providing a unique aspect of my SQL journey. From foundational SQL mastery to the elegance of SQLAlchemy and practical Flask applications, these projects showcase my ability to merge Python and SQL libraries to unlock advanced analysis and insights.

As you browse through the folders, you'll encounter a diverse range of topics,each encapsulating a unique aspect of my SQL journey:

SQL Mastery: Delve into the foundations of SQL with projects covering aggregate queries, subqueries, and the creation of views. Explore data relationships, data modeling techniques, and visualize databases using ERDs.

SQLAlchemy Adventures: Immerse yourself in the world of SQLAlchemy. Witness my journey from connecting to databases to executing basic SQL queries using engine.execute(). Witness the elegance of the SQLAlchemy ORM as I perform create, read, update, delete (CRUD) operations on data, model tables using classes, and execute advanced database manipulations.

Flask and API Prowess: Embark on web development escapades with Flask. From creating servers and defining endpoints to extracting query-variable path values and crafting APIs, you'll get a glimpse into my exploration of this dynamic framework.

Data Validation and Analysis: Take a step further into data analysis as I validate differences in means through t-tests, demonstrating my statistical prowess.

**Practical Application**

From connecting to databases using SQLAlchemy, executing SQL queries with ease, to performing complex CRUD operations via the SQLAlchemy ORM, this repository equips you with practical skills needed to interact with databases effectively. Furthermore, it extends into the world of web development, teaching you to build APIs with Flask and return JSONified query results to clients.
